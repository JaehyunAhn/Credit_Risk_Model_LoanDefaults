# Credit Risk Modeling for Loan Default

## Project Overview
* This project aims to measure the credit risk of a lending institution by calculating the expected loss of the outstanding loans
* The calculations are based on three credit risk models: PD (Probability of Default), LGD (Loss Given Default), and EAD (Exposure at Default) models
* Statistical models of logistic regression and linear regression are chosen accordingly to predict the outcome of each credit risk model
* Dataset from open source  is used to train and test the models as well as to simulate the process of calculating the expected loss of a real lending institution
